Need to decide what this is really for. If higher level of tx, should arguably be 1/75, based on \\cite{collins_retrospective_1999} data. If for fever, should be somewhere between 1/10 and 1/14. No guarantee the \\cite{collins_retrospective_1999} data is related to strains seen in Asia though. TODO: identify values from the Asia region."
